I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Guanghua School of Management at Peking University. I got my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from School of Statistics, East China Normal University in 2023, under the joint supervision of Prof. [Riquan Zhang](https://www.suibe.edu.cn/txxy/2022/1031/c5782a154108/page.htm) and Prof. [Hansheng Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/hansheng). My research interests are mainly in large-scale statistical analysis and statistical machine learning. My Chinese name is **高原**, which means "plateau" in English.
